Scratch notes for self reference

1. Find length of longest substring without repeating characters - mystring.py  [ O(n) time, O(n) space ]
2. Binary Search ( Olog n)
3. Merge sort (n log n : Number of times the list is cut in half to get down to 1 = log n, merging happens n times - so n log n)
4. Merge array/list of tuples which contains meeting (start,end) to consolidate the overlapping ones.
5. Java Test for swapping array elements.
6. Reverse words in a string
