1. Singleton

Ensures that class has only one instance, in otherwords it ensures that only one instance of it is ever
created.



2. Module level Dunder Names ( Names with two leading and two trailing underscores such as __all__, __author__)
Ref: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?
Should be placed after the docstring


3.There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.

Ref: https://hackernoon.com/understanding-the-underscore-of-python-309d1a029edc

1. For storing the value of last expression in interpreter.
Python stores last expression value to the special variable called "_".
>>> 3+1
4
>>> _
4

2. For ignoring the specific values. (so-called “I don’t care”)

#Ignore one value
>>> x,_,y=(1,2,3)
>>> x
1
>>> y
3

#Ignore multiple values
>>> x,*_,y=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
>>> x
1
>>> y
7

3. To give special meanings and functions to name of vartiables or functions.

	_singe_leading_underscore
	This convention is used for private variables, functions and classes and will be
	ignored when "from module import *" is done.

	single_trailing_underscore_
	This is often used to avoid conflict with Python keywords

	__double_leading_underscores
	This is more of a syntax than a convention. This is used to mangle the attribute names
	of a class to avoid conflics of attribute names between classes.

4. To use as ‘Internationalization(i18n)’ or ‘Localization(l10n)’ functions.
5. To separate the digits of number literal value.
